# loop : continous flow rotation
#
# types in loops : 2
#                       for loop - finite loop
#                       while loop - infinite loop

# for loop 
#       iterates over the sequence/ through sequence/ till the sequence

# syntax : 

    # for <assign var> in <variable>:
    #     .......................
    #     .......................

# while loop : by default it is infinite loop, but we can make it as finite loop also as per our requiremnt
# it will iterates till condition satisfies if condition is FALSE 'while' will stops

# syntax :

# while <expression/comdition>:
#     ........................
